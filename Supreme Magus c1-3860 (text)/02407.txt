Chapter 2398 Deep Scars (Part 2)

“Wait a second.” Solus raised her hands to put an end to the stream of thanks and to stop the soldiers before they surrounded her. “What do you mean I saved your life and your hometown? Why would Thrud do such a thing to her followers?”

“We aren’t part of the Mad Queen’s ex-army, Lady Verhen. You don’t put the fox to guard the henhouse. All the members of the city guards and local militia are being detained for interrogation.” The young soldier said.

“Oh.” Solus nodded, finally understanding why everyone was so happy to see her instead of angry. “What about Zeska? I was here the day Supreme Magus Verhen conquered the city and we left it in good shape.”

“You did but during your raid, you also took down most of Zeska’s defensive systems. When Thrud’s Forgotten came to recapture the city, the battle was long and bloody.

“Also, once you get inside, you’ll have to face a lot of rage and discontent. To us, you are a hero, but to the citizens of Zeska, you are a bloodthirsty monster.”

“The citizens won’t see it that way.” A middle-aged man with red hair and the stripes of a captain said. “They’ll treat you like a conqueror who has come to gloat over the lives she has destroyed. No matter what you do, they’ll show you no gratitude.”

“I’m not doing this for them so I don’t care.” Solus replied.

“Very well.” The captain nodded while giving her the salute. “Allow me to at least assign you an honor guard to guide you.”

He chose the biggest, meanest, and strongest people from the garrison. Each man was a skilled soldier who could use tier two magic in case the crowd went wild and needed to be forced to disperse.

Several tents had been set up to form a field hospital whose size rivaled the one in Kandria during the plague.ƒ𝐫𝒆e𝓌𝒆𝚋𝗻૦𝘷𝑒𝙡. 𝑐𝘰𝐦

Solus had traveled a lot during Lith’s tours as a Ranger while Tista had infiltrated more than one occupied city so they both knew that the truth was much more unpleasant.

The captain led them inside one of the smallest tents and introduced them to the Healer in charge of the camp.

“Great Mage Tista Verhen.” She showed her own ID while unfolding her wings and opening the three extra eyes.

Barma and the captain were flabbergasted by her origin as much as her friends were by her words.

‘I’m not, but Dawn is.’ Nyka replied. ‘Give her a chance, she would put Manohar to shame.’

“For these people, Lith Verhen is the bogeyman. If they see another monster with multiple eyes, the citizens of Zeska will-“

“Apologies, Great Mage Verhen.” Barma gave her a bow as shallow as his words. “What can I do for you?”

“Nothing. I came here because I want to help you. Do you have enough healers?” Solus asked.

“On top of that, there’s always someone who gets ill or hurt. There are riots almost on a daily basis due to people demanding more food, better accommodations, and the release of their family members who have been arrested.”

“Bottom line, the citizens fight among themselves and against us. For every ten people we treat, nine walk into the hospital. If you really want to help, pick a tent and knock yourself out.” The Healer waved his hand, eager to get the non-human out of his hair.

“If I may give you a suggestion, dear Great Mages, take those robes off.” Barma’s voice was cold and devoid of respect. “Here your rank will garner you no respect, just more trouble.”

Tista snorted, but she followed his advice and so did Solus.
